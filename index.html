                        Kim Ki-Taek (Song Kang-Ho), an unemployed driver, lives with his wife Choong-Sook (Jang Hye-Jin), son Ki-Woo (Choi Woo-Shik) and daughter Ki-Jeong (Park So-Dam) in a shabby semi-basement apartment. The family struggles to survive, working low-paying gigs such as folding pizza boxes. Ki-Woo's friend Min-Hyuk (Park Seo-Joon) visits the family and gifts them a large rock supposed to bring them wealth, before he leaves to study abroad. He suggests Ki-Woo take over his job as an English tutor for the wealthy Park family's youngest daughter, Da-Hye (Jung Ji-So).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        Min-Hyuk has feelings for Da-Hye and figures that she will be safe with Ki-Woo, till he graduates college. In the lavish Park mansion, Ki-Woo is interviewed by Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-Jeong) to tutor Da-Hye and is hired after Mrs. Park sees his talents (His degrees which were faked by his sister Ki-Jeong who is a master at forgery) in action. Learning of Mrs. Park's struggle to find an art teacher for her younger child, Da-Song, Ki-Woo suggests a "professional" named Jessica, who in reality is Ki-Jeong. Once hired, Ki-Jeong gets Mr. Park's (Lee Sun-Kyun) driver fired (The driver hits on Ki-Jeong and she accuses him of sexual harassment by placing her panties in the back seat of the Mercedes he is in charge of) and replaced with her "Uncle Kim": Ki-Taek.

                    <p class="text">
                        The Kims soon get housekeeper Moon-Kwang (Lee Jung-Eun) fired (Moon-Kwang had a rule that the family could not eat peaches, but Ki-Jeong discovers that its because Moon-Kwang herself is severely allergic to it and the manipulate the Park family to believe that Moon-Kwang had Tuberculosis. This enrages Mrs. Park, who fires her), with Choong-Sook hired in her place, employing the entire Kim family. Ki-Woo ends up kissing Da-Hye and both are attracted to each other.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        The Parks go on an overnight camping trip, leaving the mansion in Choong-Sook's care. The Kims take the opportunity to have a drunken party in the mansion, during which Ki-Woo confesses to his family that he is in love with Da-Hye. In the middle of their celebration, Moon-Kwang (Lee Jung-Eun) rings the bell and claims that she came to retrieve something in the basement. The other Kims hide, then Choong-Sook lets Moon-Kwang in. Heading to the basement, the former housekeeper opens a secret bunker, revealing that her husband, Geun-Sae (Park Myung-Hoon), has been hiding for 4 years to avoid loan sharks. As Choong-Sook threatens to call the police, the rest of the Kims, eavesdropping, accidentally stumble into view. Moon-Kwang quickly records footage of the new "staff" addressing each other as father and children, then threatens to send the clip to the Parks.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        The Parks call Choong-Sook to announce that the heavy rain has ruined their camping trip, and they will be home soon. The Kims scramble to confine Moon-Kwang and Geun-Sae, then clean up and hide, while Choong-Sook prepares some food requested by Mrs. Park. Moon-Kwang breaks free and runs up into the kitchen, but Choong-Sook pushes her down the basement stairs, severely wounding her head. While eating, Mrs. Park tells Choong-Sook that her son was traumatized one birthday by what he thought was a ghost coming up from the basement (he just saw Moon-Kwang's husband coming into the kitchen from the basement stairs).

                    <p class="text">
                        Moon-Kwang's husband is tied up by Ki-Taek and he reveals to him that he has been trying to communicate with Mr Park via Morse code for several years (a light in the dining room has a switch in the basement) (but Mr Park, never understood Morse code and hence never understood the message). After a few close calls, the other three Kims leave the mansion undetected. They run back to their apartment, which has been flooded by the storm. They salvage what they can, Ki-Woo carrying the large "lucky rock" Min-Hyuk gifted his family earlier. The three, along with other displaced citizens, sleep in a gymnasium. Meanwhile, Moon-Kwang dies from her concussion as Geun-Sae cries. but before dying she cuts off the tape that Ki-Taek had used to tie her husband up, thus freeing him.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        The following day, Mrs. Park throws a birthday party for Da-Song (Jung Hyun-Joon) and ask the Kims to come over and help with all the chores (the Kims are bummed as they feel that the Parks are totally oblivious to the lives of ordinary people. Ki-Taek is especially miffed when Mrs and Mr Park, both make insensitive comments about air quality improving from all the rain from the previous night). During the party, Ki-Woo carries the rock down to the bunker, intending to kill Geun-Sae. Geun-Sae ambushes Ki-Woo, cracks his head open with the rock, then crashes the party, where he stabs Ki-Jeong in the chest. Geun-Sae's sudden appearance triggers Da-Song's traumatic memory, causing the child to have a seizure. Ki-Taek rushes to stop Ki-Jeong's bleeding, while Mr. Park yells at him for the car keys, so Park can drive Da-Song to the hospital. The key lands under the fighting Choong-Sook and Geun-Sae, before Choong-Sook kills Geun-Sae with a meat skewer. Mr. Park retrieves the key, while recoiling from Geun-Sae's "poor man's smell." Ki-Taek, witnessing Mr. Park's reaction to the smell, also his own, snaps, fatally stabs him, then flees.

                    <p class="text">
                        The ending is narrated by Ki-Woo, recounting that Ki-Jeong died from her wounds, while he required brain surgery and suffered a weeks-long coma; he and Choong-Sook went to trial and were sentenced to probation. Later, watching the Parks' mansion, Ki-Woo notices a light flickering in Morse code - a message from Ki-Taek, who managed to retreat into the bunker in the chaos, and has been hiding from and living off of the new owners. Ki-Woo promises that one day, he will earn enough money to buy the house and free his father. Fantasizing about the day of their reunion, Ki-Woo ends his letter sitting in the shabby semi-basement apartment where the movie began.

                        <h2>Class</h2>
                        One of the most evident and persistent themes in the film is class. At the start of the film, we are introduced to the Kims, a family struggling to live under impoverished conditions. When they get jobs working for the wealthy Park family, one-by-one, they see just how easy some people have it, and how much more luxuriously some people live. Throughout the film, they covet the lives of their employers, and get caught up in a struggle with Moon-gwang and her husband, who are also trying to benefit from the wealth of the Park family.
                        Wealth is depicted in many different lights throughout the film. It's shown as something that makes one brighter, more natural, nicer, but also something that dulls one's sense of accountability and meaning, that puts one "out of touch." The Parks are kind, but also shallow, helpless, and naive in many ways. The security of wealth remains the dream of the Kim family for the entirety of the film, with Ki-woo dreaming of buying the Parks' old house at the end of the film. However, the film also seeks to show the ways that wealth and class inequality is what creates the violence that bursts out in the final act.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        <h2>Parasitism</h2>
                        The title suggests that the characters are parasites of some kind, entities that feed off a larger host. In interviews, director Bong Joon-ho has suggested that while the most obvious representations of parasites are the poor characters in the film—both the Kim family as well as Moon-gwang and Geun-sae—he also suggests that one might just as easily say that the Park family are the parasitical entity, in that they are completely helpless and feed off the skills and obedience of their employees.
                        Finally, one might also say that the central parasite in the film is class inequality itself. The aspirational wealth of the Parks is a kind of parasite of competition, a nagging sense of "never enough." Likewise, the poorer characters share this parasite, the desire to become upwardly mobile and enjoy all the benefits of wealth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        <h2>Violence</h2>
                        Violence emerges slowly in the film, as a companion to class inequality and desperation. Firstly, there is the psychological and political violence that the Park family enacts on the Kim family, inviting them into their lives, but also excluding them in ways that make clear their inequality.
                        Then, when the Kims are staying at the Parks' house, Chung-sook teases Ki-taek, calling him a "cockroach," and playing at the kind of structural violence that they face as poor people. Then, the struggle that breaks out between Moon-gwang, her husband, and the Kims is a perverse violence, one in which each party is fighting to maintain their relation to the Parks' wealth, in hopes that it can protect them from the hardships of life.
                        We see many different kinds of violence in the film, but none so gruesome as that of the final scenes. Chung-sook pushes Moon-gwang down the stairs. Geun-sae bludgeons Ki-woo with his rock, then stabs Ki-jung. Chung-sook stabs Geun-sae with a meat skewer to protect herself. Ki-taek stabs Mr. Park in a rage, after seeing his boss behave condescendingly towards the smell of Geun-sae. The end of the film is a bloodbath, when all the implicit violence of the structural and political positions of the characters comes brutally out into the open.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        <h2>Deception</h2>
                        A great deal of the humor and pleasure of the film is watching the Kim family pull one over on the unsuspecting Parks. After Ki-woo gets hired as a tutor, he sets each of his family members up with a job, one by one, in the Park household. While the Parks do not know it, not only are all of their employees' qualifications fabricated, but they are all part of the same family. This creates a highly humorous and suspenseful dramatic irony, in which the viewer watches the Kims figure out how to keep their plot a secret, even in the most unthinkable circumstances. For instance, when the Parks return home from their camping trip unexpectedly, they wander through their home, blithely unaware of the fact that Moon-gwang and her husband are trapped in a bunker beneath the house, or that Ki-jung, Ki-woo, and Ki-taek are all lying underneath the coffee table in the living room.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        <h2>Hope</h2>
                        Something that keeps the Kim family going is their sense of hope. They are tired of not being able to make ends meet, and are cynical about their class position in many ways, but they also hold onto a hope that their lives will improve, and it is this hope that keeps them going, even when they must lie in order to secure work.
                        Then, at the end, we see the theme of hope embodied in Ki-woo and Ki-taek, who correspond with one another while Ki-taek is squatting in the basement bunker after having killed Mr. Park. Ki-taek keeps himself alive, living the life of a scavenger, because he has the hope that his luck might change someday. Ki-woo hopes to one day be wealthy enough to purchase the house, and we see his fantasy on the screen. He enters the house, and Ki-taek simply wanders up the stairs, reunited with Chung-sook and his son. The final image of the film is Ki-woo penning this letter of hope to his father, imagining a better life for his family, even after all they have endured.

                        A great deal of the humor and pleasure of the film is watching the Kim family pull one over on the unsuspecting Parks. After Ki-woo gets hired as a tutor, he sets each of his family members up with a job, one by one, in the Park household. While the Parks do not know it, not only are all of their employees' qualifications fabricated, but they are all part of the same family. This creates a highly humorous and suspenseful dramatic irony, in which the viewer watches the Kims figure out how to keep their plot a secret, even in the most unthinkable circumstances. For instance, when the Parks return home from their camping trip unexpectedly, they wander through their home, blithely unaware of the fact that Moon-gwang and her husband are trapped in a bunker beneath the house, or that Ki-jung, Ki-woo, and Ki-taek are all lying underneath the coffee table in the living room.

                        <h2>Capitalism and Colonialism</h2>
                        The class struggle that Bong Joon-ho depicts is one that is directly connected to the inequalities built into a capitalistic system. Mr. Park is a well-educated businessman who has been afforded many more opportunities than any member of the Kim family. His opportunities are the result of his already having come from a wealthy family. The pit that the Kims find themselves in, in which they are unable to secure employment that can support them, is not a reflection of their abilities, but of their position within a capitalist economy.
                        Sewn into this depiction of capitalism is the suggestion of colonialism. The Parks feel entitled to take up more space than the Kims, which is in itself a kind of colonial impulse. The story can be seen as an allegory for the colonialism that is inherent to capitalistic growth. This theme is even hinted at when young Da-song and his father Mr. Park are wearing Native American headdresses at the party when the violence breaks out.

                        The Parasite characters feature Bong Joon-ho's most renowned cast, thanks to the global success that the 2019 thriller garnered. From winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes to creating history as the first non-English-language film to receive the Academy Award for Best Picture, Parasite introduced its acclaimed writer-director and its Korean-language-speaking cast to a larger audience. Revolving around a poor family's deceptive scheme to gain employment in a rich household, Parasite doubles as an anti-rich satire and an anxiety-inducing thriller. As is the case with Bong Joon-ho movies, Parasite is characterized by drastic tonal shifts, and the SAG Award-winning ensemble makes the best use of these transitions.

                        From capturing the amusement of mundane everyday activities to going down a dark path of homicidal chaos, the Parasite characters go through a lot. The sheer unpredictability of its plot makes Parasite one of the best movies to switch its style halfway through. Bong's cast plays a pivotal role with their nuanced performances not foreshadowing any of the final shocks. Reuniting with his frequent collaborator Song Kang-ho, the filmmaker assembled a stellar group of acting veterans and then-new faces from his home country. Here's a guide to the Parasite characters, the actors who play them, and what else each actor is known for.

                                    <b>Song Kang-ho As Kim Ki-taek (The Patriarch Of The Kim Family)</b>,
                                    Song Kang-ho leads the Parasite cast as Kim Ki-taek, the patriarch of the Kim family. He's a cheerful person and tries his best to provide for his wife and children even as they dwell in a congested semi-basement flat in Seoul. His aspirations to earn more for his family leads him down a spiral of dark events to Parasite's ending. Song previously collaborated with Bong Joon-ho on three films before being cast in Parasite, playing Detective Park Doo-man in the crime thriller Memories of Murder, snack vendor Park Gang-du in the monster film Host and train designer Namgoong Minsoo in the sci-fi action thriller —and Bong's English-language debut — Snowpiercer.
                                    Many of Song Kang-ho’s best movies are cult favorites in South Korea. Apart from working for Bong, he has also collaborated with renowned Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook, acting in three of his films. He appeared in Joint Security Area as Sgt. Oh Kyeong-pil, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance as revenge-seeking father Park Dong-jin, and Thirst as priest-turned-vampire Sang-hyun. Song also portrayed the titular protagonist in the historical action drama A Taxi Driver. After Parasite, he notably appeared in Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Korean-language drama Broker.

                                    Kim Chung-sook is the matriarch of the Kim family who works as a housekeeper at the Park house. A generally kind-hearted person, Chung-sook is an efficient problem solver and remains calm even in some of the most intense moments of the thriller. Before joining the Parasite cast as Chung-sook, Jang Hye-Jin was known for appearing in the popular Korean romance series Crash Landing on You, in which she played protagonist Dan’s ambitious mother, Ko Myeong-eun. She also collaborated with Korean director Lee Chang-dong, playing Park Myung-Suk in Secret Sunshine, which also starred Parasite's Song Kang-ho. She reunited with the filmmaker for Poetry, being credited as Mr. Kang's second daughter-in-law.

An academically gifted student, he poses as an English tutor to teach the Parks’ daughter, with whom he also starts a romantic relationship. He is highly intelligent but shy and mild-mannered in terms of his personality. The character is played by Choi Woo-shik, who first gained recognition as troubled teenager Yeong-jae in the coming-of-age drama Set Me Free. The Parasite cast member also reached a wider audience with the zombie survival thriller Train To Busan, where he played high school baseball player Min Yong-guk.

She is skilled at Photoshop to forge documents, and it’s this deception that makes it possible for her brother — and later the rest of her family — to gain employment at the Parks’ residence. She also adds to one of Parasite’s most surprisingly funny moments as she sings a jingle to remember her new alias’s backstory. Apart from Parasite, Park So-dam gained recognition for playing the allegedly demonically possessed girl Young-shin in The Priests and high-school athlete Eun Ha-won in the romantic K-drama Cinderella with Four Knights.

He is a wealthy businessman, and even though he represents the parasitic elite class, he is otherwise a mild-mannered person. After being relegated to minor TV roles, Lee broke out as music producer Choi Han-sung in the romantic series Coffee Prince. In movies, he collaborated with arthouse auteur Hong Sang-soo, playing North Korean student Yoon Kyeong-soo in Night and Day, short film director Nam Jin-gu in Oki’s Movie, and film studies professor Lee Seong-joon in Nobody’s Daughter. He sadly died on December 27, 2023.

Despite her efforts to be a caring parent, she can’t form a close bond with her children, relying on servants to take care of them. She's as kind as her husband but can come across as tone-deaf in front of people who are of a lower social status. The character is played in Parasitte by Cho Yeo-jeong, who appeared in the historical romance The Servant as Seong Chunhyang, the heroine of the Korean folktale Chunhyangjeon. She also starred in the erotic romance films The Concubine and Obsessed and the TV shows Divorce Lawyer in Love and I Need Romance.

Park Da-hye is played in Parasite by Jung Ji-so, who broke out as a child star in May Queen as a younger version of the supporting character Jang In-hwa. She also appeared in the romantic K-drama W, in which she played a younger version of its surgeon protagonist, Oh Yeon-Joo.

                        The way characters speak tells us a lot about them. The Parks use polite but impersonal language, highlighting their detachment from the Kim family. In contrast, the Kims use informal language and slang, underlining their closeness and struggle. The dialogue is full of lines that explore the film's central ideas.

                    <p class="text">
                        Quotes like "They are nice because they are rich" or "If there's one thing I hate, it's people who cross the line" directly address class disparity and the lengths people go to in a desperate situation, the dialogue is considered a strength of Parasite, helping to make the film both entertaining and thought-provoking.

                    <p class="text">
                        The characters reveal details about themselves and their situations through seemingly casual conversations. This keeps the audience engaged in piecing together the bigger picture and the characters' motivations. The film uses dark humor masterfully. Dialogue often contains ironic barbs that highlight the absurdity of the situation – like the wealthy Parks being oblivious to the struggles happening right under their noses. This humor adds tension and keeps the audience off-balance.

                    <p class="text">
                        As the plot progresses, the dialogue reflects the changing relationships between characters. Initially polite and respectful exchanges between the Kims and Parks become increasingly strained and laced with suspicion. This shift underscores the growing instability and danger lurking beneath the surface.

                        "Parasite" is a masterclass in using words to achieve multiple goals. It advances the plot, reveals character motivations, and delivers sharp social commentary, all while keeping the audience engaged and on the edge of their seats.

                        Parasite is widely praised for its role in storytelling and creating a tense atmosphere. The huge disparity between the wealthy Parks and the impoverished Kims is portrayed in the movie using lighting and frame. The Kims' small, gloomy, and disorganized basement contrasts with the spacious, light-filled Park mansion with its tall ceilings. In the Kims' little apartment, the camera frequently seems constrained; in contrast, it can move freely throughout the Park home. This illustrates how little opportunities the characters have.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        Long takes with slow camera pans or Steadicam shots create a sense of suspense, while handheld camerawork during chaotic moments adds to the urgency. Parasite is deliberate and intentional. It goes beyond just capturing the scene and actively contributes to the film's themes and story.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        The camerawork itself becomes a character, subtly guiding the audience's emotions. Long takes with subtle pans and zooms build tension, especially during pivotal moments. The camera lingers on seemingly insignificant details, foreshadowing plot points and adding a layer of mystery. In the famous pizza box scene, for example, the camera lingers on the box as it's tossed into the rain, hinting at the hidden world beneath the Park's seemingly perfect life.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        This masterful use of cinematography isn't just about aesthetics; it's a storytelling device in itself. By using space, framing, and camera movement, "Parasite" visually underlines its themes of class division, social inequality, and the struggle to survive in a world stacked against you. It's a brilliant example of how film can be a truly immersive experience, where every visual element contributes to the narrative power of the story.

                        The focus wasn't just on putting scenes together, but meticulously choosing the best shots and finding the right rhythm for each sequence. As a result, the movie had a tight, thrilling vibe. There wasn't a lot of additional film taken from various viewpoints in several instances. In order to put together the most powerful sequence possible, the editor had to exercise creative judgment.

                        The movie deftly combines thriller and humor genres. The audience was kept interested by the editing, which contributed to a smooth transition between these tonal changes. The movie used montage scenes to effectively communicate ideas and heighten the suspense.

                        Editor Jinmo Yang's work is praised for its seamless pacing and ability to build tension. Cuts create a clear conversation between scenes, like the Kims fleeing the rain while the Parks deal with the sewage backup. This connects the two worlds and emphasizes the disparity. The editing keeps pace with the movie's genre-bending nature, smoothly transitioning between dark humor, social commentary, and thriller moments. Yang avoids excessive cuts, letting some scenes play out with long takes, which builds suspense and allows the actors' performances to shine.

                        The uniqueness of Parasite's music and the way it complemented the movie's themes won it praise from critics. Instead of being expansive or sweeping, the music aims to evoke a sense of discomfort and uncertainty, reflecting the protagonists' fragile circumstances. The idea that something is odd and unpredictable is reinforced by the sporadic forays into various musical styles.

                    <p class="text">
                        The score by Jung Jae-il is masterful. Its minimalism, with spare piano notes and unsettling percussion, creates a pervasive sense of unease that mirrors the growing tension in the film. It's like a constant low hum of anxiety that perfectly underscores the dark humor and thriller aspects of the story.

                    <p class="text">
                        The choice to include contrasting pieces, like the Italian song and the director's original song, adds another layer of intrigue. These moments disrupt the established mood, reflecting the characters' own attempts to disrupt the established social order. The soundtrack becomes a character itself, reflecting the unsettling world of the film.

                        Even before Bong Joon-ho grabbed four Oscars, including best picture and best director, for his black comedy masterpiece "Parasite," the South Korean auteur was not a new kid on the block.

                        With seven features on his directorial career, including "Parasite," he has earned a nickname of "Bongtail" at home and abroad, a combination of his family name and the English word "detail."

                        Even though he mentioned several times in interviews that he does not like this nickname, his fellow actors and colleagues praise him for his detailed directing and meticulous care for all film staff.

                        His hand-drawn storyboards exemplify Bong's detail-oriented pre-production process. He meticulously plans every frame of his films through a set of sketches that include detailed description of background settings, kinetic compositions of each actor and mise-en-scene.

                        Based on these own pre-sketches, the director draws the entire movie in his brain from the offset and goes on shooting, so that he requires only necessary, planned shot or take during filming.

                        Song Kang-ho, a Bong's favorite who starred in four of seven Bong's films, said his perfectly designed scenario and pre-production makes actors and actress focus on acting and emotion that the story requires.
                        "Bong is famous for exquisiteness. In Bong's cinematic world, everything is calculated and sophisticatedly constructed," Song said in a press conference at the Cannes Film Festival last year, where "Parasite" was awarded the highest honor, the Palme d'Or.
                        "That lifts the burden of actors who have to fully express the whole space and time in front of the camera."
                        Chris Evans, a Hollywood actor who worked with Bong on 2013 thriller "Snowpiercer," said he was amazed by Bong's unique dramaturgy and trusts his cinematic vision.
                        "Director Bong has storyboards laid out so that ... he has already edited it in his brain," he said in an interview after "Snowpiercer." "It's like building a house and instead of needing a bag of nails, it is like saying, 'I need 53 nails.'"
                        Bong's exactitude and fineness in directing come along with his warm leadership as he shows sincere interest in and genuine concern for others.
                        "Before shooting, I was worried about his style. I'd thought he would be very sensitive or high-strung," said Lee Sun-kyun, who plays the role of Mr. Park, the father of a wealthy family in "Parasite." "But he was totally different. He never gets angry even in a situation where everybody feels irritated."
                        Moreover, Bong was one of the filmmakers in South Korea to spearhead the move to strictly comply with a guideline to prevent overtime work and unpaid wages on shooting sites.
                        The guideline, which was mapped out in 2014, led to a rise in production costs but contributed to improving working conditions in the industry.
                        In particular, he carefully looked after a child actor who played the role of Mr. Park's son in "Parasite." He even postponed the shooting of the child's scene for a month, as the weather was too hot for the kid to act. (Yonhap)
